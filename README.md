# 🚗 Automobile Sales Analytics Project

## 📊 Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of automobile sales performance using **Excel PivotTables**, **Slicers**, and **Timelines** — supported by future integration with **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**.  
The main goal is to identify key sales patterns, customer behavior, and profitability insights that empower management to make data-driven decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and standardize raw automobile sales data for accuracy.
- Build analytical pivot tables to evaluate:
  - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
  - Profitability and Cumulative Profit
  - Market Segmentation and Deal Size Trends
- Implement dynamic filters (Slicers & Timelines) for interactivity.
- Prepare datasets for advanced visualization (Power BI, Looker, Cognos).

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Customer Retention:** Repeat customers account for over 60% of total sales revenue.
- **Regional Performance:** Germany, France, and the USA dominate profit margins.
- **Product Line Insights:** Classic Cars and Motorcycles are top-performing segments.
- **Seasonality:** Q2 and Q4 show strong sales growth due to new model releases.

## 🎨 Dashboard Interactivity
The workbook includes:
- 🕓 **Timeline:** Filter by Order Date (month, quarter, or year)
- 🌍 **Slicer 1:** Filter by Country
- 🚙 **Slicer 2:** Filter by Product Line

All pivot tables update simultaneously when these controls are used, creating a dynamic analysis experience.

## 🧠 Next Steps
- Load cleaned data into SQL Server for automation.
- Build a Power BI dashboard connected to live sales data.
- Implement Python-based data pipeline for monthly updates.
- Add forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) for sales prediction.
